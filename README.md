Deep Probabilistic Scaling is an uncertainty quantification tool for the control of misclassification error in (binary) neural classification. The algorithm relies on probabilistic scaling, a branch of [order statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic) for non-parametric inference with confidence bounds on the prediction. 

Deep Probabilistic Scaling is a direct application of [Scalable Classification](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/probabilistic-safety-regions-via-finite) to convolutional neural networks for (binary) classification
